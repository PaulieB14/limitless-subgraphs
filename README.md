# Limitless Subgraphs + MCP Server

Subgraphs and MCP server for [Limitless Exchange](https://limitless.exchange) prediction markets on Base.

## Subgraphs

Two subgraphs indexing different exchange venues on the same CTF (Conditional Tokens Framework):

| Subgraph | What it indexes |
|---|---|
| `limitless-simple-markets` | Binary Yes/No markets — CTF Exchange v1/v2/v3 |
| `limitless-negrisk-markets` | Multi-outcome category markets — NegRisk Exchange v1/v2/v3 |

Both share the same CTF contract (`0xC9c9...`) for conditions, positions, splits, merges, and redemptions. Each indexes its own set of exchange contracts for markets and trades.

### Entities

- **Condition** — prepared markets with oracle, resolution status, payouts
- **Market / NegRiskMarket** — exchange-registered markets with volume, trade counts, fees
- **Trade** (immutable) — individual order fills with maker/taker, price, USD amounts
- **UserPosition** — per-user token balances and PnL
- **Split / Merge / Redemption** (immutable) — CTF liquidity events
- **User** — aggregated trader stats
- **MarketDailySnapshot / GlobalDailySnapshot** — daily time series
- **GlobalStats** — protocol-wide singleton

| `get_market_trades` | Trade feed for a specific market |
| `get_market_daily_snapshots` | Daily volume/trades/fees for a market |
